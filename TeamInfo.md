## Project Summary

For people who tend to cook at home to address their meals, it is sometimes difficult to decide what to eat, and the combinations of food for each dish. Therefore, our objective is to create a website that can give people some choices for their next meal based on their preferences for already stored ingredients and spices. Additionally, we also provide the cost for each meal, estimated time for cooking and the calories intake.

To be more specific, we will store different ingredients of different kinds such as meat, vegetables and fruits, as well as various types of spices, even from different cultural preferences. For each time the user gives any types of ingredients or spices they wish to have for the next meal, possible cuisines will be posted on a website ordered by calories and the rate for the cuisines.
